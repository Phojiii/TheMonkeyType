Typing fast isn’t just about hitting keys quickly — it’s about rhythm,
accuracy, and comfort. Here are a few tips to help you level up:

1. **Use all your fingers** — practice proper hand placement.
2. **Start slow** and focus on accuracy over speed.
3. **Stay consistent** — practice short sessions daily.
4. **Try different durations** (15s, 30s, 60s) on TheMonkeyType.
5. **Relax your hands and shoulders** to reduce tension.
